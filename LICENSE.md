If you find inspiration within my codelines feel free to use my approach within your software.

Should the inspiration go beyond some trivial lines of code I'd ask for some credit in your
software and a link back to my website https://www.eric-poehlsen.de

As I have learned from the code of others maybe you learn something from my code ... even
if only as a bad example ...
